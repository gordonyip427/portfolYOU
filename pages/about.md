# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** (or you may know me as Kai/Kai Hou from my publications) :wave:,<br>
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working within the [exoplanet group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/exoplanets/research) at UCL. I am also a member of the [Ariel Space Mission]((https://arielmission.space/)), in particular I am a coodinator of the Machine Learning Working Group. My research focuses on applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to help us better understand exoplanets (aka planets outside our solar system), and in particular their atmospheres. You can find my past and current works in Projects.
